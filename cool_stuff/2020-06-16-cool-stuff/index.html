<h2 id="books-and-stuff">Books and Stuff</h2>
<p><strong>Oct 2022</strong>: I&rsquo;m currently reading James Gleick&rsquo;s book, <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/60765/the-information-by-james-gleick/"><em>The Information</em></a>, which provides a very detailed history of humanity&rsquo;s relationship with <em>information</em> - oral, written, digital, all kinds! I&rsquo;m really enjoying it because it weaves a wide-ranging set of ideas, people, and locations together to tell the story of how we&rsquo;ve understood, catalogued, and communicated our ideas over the ages, and how the media that we use for these purposes has changed how we think.</p>
<p><strong>Aug 2022</strong>: I am chipping away at Jane Jacobs&rsquo; excellent book on how we can build better, safer, more vibrant cities: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_and_Life_of_Great_American_Cities"><em>The Death and Life of Great American Cities</em></a>. It&rsquo;s very life-changing in the way that it&rsquo;s really making me notice small nuances of the cities I&rsquo;ve visited and lived in that made them the way they were! I hope to write a little essy about it after I&rsquo;m done!</p>

<h2 id="theatre">Theatre</h2>
<p>During my undergrad years, I spent a lot of time doing theatre with my uni&rsquo;s Drama Club. Some of my favourite playwrights are Edward Albee, Annie Baker and Will Eno.</p>
<p>I directed three full-length stage plays, assisted on two others, and competed at national-level collegiate theatre competitions thrice. Here&rsquo;s a poster for the last play I ever directed, <a href="https://www.dramatists.com/cgi-bin/db/single.asp?key=5451">Duncan Macmillan&rsquo;s <em>Every Brilliant Thing</em></a>, which we also adapted for a more Indian context.</p>
<h3 id="film">Film</h3>
<p>I love watching movies and thinking about why I (and everyone else) loves watching movies! Naturally, this has <a href="/pdfs/2022-tropes-poster.pdf">bled into my work</a> but more than that, I love writing essays about <a href="https://letterboxd.com/sachnish/likes/films/">the films I&rsquo;ve loved and adored</a>. One day, I hope to have an essay published by my favourite film publication, <a href="https://www.brightwalldarkroom.com"><em>Bright Wall Dark Room</em></a>.</p>
<!-- You can find some cool posters we made for my other plays on [this](../play_posters) page.  -->

<h2 id="other-stuff-i-do">Other Stuff I Do</h2>
<ul>
<li>Play tabletop games with my friends - I am particularly a fan of <em>Betrayal at House on the Hill</em>, <em>Codenames</em>, and <em>Love Letter</em>.</li>
<li>Play 90s-style point-and-click adventure games. The mania began with Monkey Island, continued with the Discworld games, and I have recently been daydreaming about making my own games with Twine or something similar.</li>
<li>Take photos of stuff, I really really really enjoy (amateur) photography.</li>
