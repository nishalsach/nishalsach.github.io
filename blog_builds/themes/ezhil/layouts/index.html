				<p> Hi, I'm Sachita, a 4th-year PhD in human-computer interaction and AI @ Northwestern University advised by <a href="http://www.nickdiakopoulos.com">Dr. Nick Diakopoulos</a>. I design <b>human-centered AI systems</b> that support <b>sense-making and creativity</b> for news reporters as they engage with swathes of information. </p> 
				
				<p> In particular, I design systems to support science journalists as they <b>discover, understand, and brainstorm newsworthy stories</b>. I endeavor to align these systems with journalists' <b>professional and ethical values</b>, as well as to center <b>user agency, contextual flexibility, and AI accountability</b>. </p>
				
				<p> I have presented my work at HCI/AI conferences like CSCW, CHI, DIS, and FAccT, as well as at journalism conferences like Big Local News and SRCCON.</p>
				
				<!-- Before this, I completed my undergrad in Computer Science and Engineering at <a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/">BITS Pilani's beautiful Goa campus</a>.</p> -->
					
				<!-- <p>I'm looking for <b> internships for Summer 2024</b>. Please reach out if my work sounds relevant/interesting/fun :)</p> -->

				<!-- <p>My research leverages methods and approaches from HCI, NLP and ML to explore, build, and evaluate intelligent interfaces that incorporate journalistic values, shape professional practices, and support the societal and ethical responsibilities of the profession. </p> 
					 -->
				<!-- <p>This leads me to conduct mixed-methods work such as survey design, ML model training and testing, human evaluation studies for LLMs, UI design, and interview studies. Ultimately, I want to design algorithmic interfaces that priortize users' autonomy over their tools, support flexibility based on users' context, and provide transparency about computationally-supported decision-making. </p> -->
