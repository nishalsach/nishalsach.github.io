				<p> Hi, I'm Sachita, and I design information retrieval systems to help science/technology journalists discover + understand newsworthy stories from the latest scientific research. This task is often difficult for journalists because large repositories of science articles can be difficult and time-consuming to sift through to unearth good quality stories. I approach this research from a human-centered perspective, by trying to co-design with journalists and conducting mixed-methods work. I thus draw from methods in HCI, natural language processing, and machine learning.</p>
