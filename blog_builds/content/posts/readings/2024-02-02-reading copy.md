I'm trying out something new this year, where I maintain a log of cool things I read (or watch, or listen to) around my work or academic interests. I think logging and describing these things can be good for my sense-making process in the long term, or generally help me feel sane when I look at the calendar on a Friday and exclaim "Where did the week go? ðŸ« ". Now, I will know, where the week went.
