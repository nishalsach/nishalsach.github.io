- There's been lots of problems with BARD and stuff using data from news sites and this reducing clickthroughs for them
- Revenues change with ads and so it's not surprising that publishers hate this
- Now we have this issue around generative models kind of making it worse because they directly pull the content and generate summaries off of it
- Last week, Google put out a press release telling news publishers they can opt out: 

> Today weâ€™re announcing Google-Extended, a new control that web publishers can use to manage whether their sites help improve Bard and Vertex AI generative APIs, including future generations of models that power those products. By using Google-Extended to control access to content on a site, a website administrator can choose whether to help these AI models become more accurate and capable over time.

- Beyond the funny phrasing (oh so opting out means we don't care about accuracy and capability of informattion systems that can deliver the news? shouldn't we ask why they're delivering the news in the first place?)
