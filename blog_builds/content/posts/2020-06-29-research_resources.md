Hello, here's a collection of articles and general advice about research practices/MS and PhD apps that I've found to be pretty handy. I'm compiling it here for not only my own reference, but also in case it can be of help to someone else!

### Applying for for PhD

- [Georger Iskander's Guide to STEM PhD Applications](https://github.com/gwisk/gradguide): This guide was written (and last updated June 2020) by a student at Yale who applied for PhD programs in Physics. It's extremely comprehensive and contains loads of general advice about everything from LORs to SOPs to fellowships!
