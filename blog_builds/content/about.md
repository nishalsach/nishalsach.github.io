- Hi, I'm Sachita, and I am a 3rd-year PhD student at Northwestern University in [Technology and Social Behaviour](https://tsb.northwestern.edu), a joint PhD program spanning Communication Studies üí¨ and Computer Science üñ•Ô∏è.

- I work right at the intersection of human-computer interaction and journalism, and my work examines how recommender systems mediate attention towards different events and information - for journalists and their audiences alike. We just published some new work about the [human-centered design, and preliminary evaluation of such recommender systems](https://nishalsach.github.io/pdfs/2022-newsworthiness.pdf).

- In 2020, I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering at [BITS Pilani's Goa Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/) in India, which is an spectacularly beautiful place. I feel incredibly lucky I got to experience this :)

- In 2020, I also interned at Microsoft Research, where I studied how influencers and other prominent individuals leverage social media platforms to engage in agenda-setting. We  just published some of that work over the past year or so [here](/pdfs/2022-voting-with-the-stars.pdf) and [here](/pdfs/2022-devotees.pdf).

<!-- - Over my research career thus far, I've worked with some wonderful people on some fascinating ideas such as:
    - running computer simulations to model evolutionary theories, 
    - designing visualizations to communicate the impact of climate change, 
    - studying the novelty of tropes in films, 
    - working with journalists to design recommender systems for newsrooms   -->


<!-- I completed my undergraduate thesis in 2019 under [Dr. Luis Amaral](https://amaral.northwestern.edu/people/amaral/) at Northwestern Univeristy, where I studied the interplay and evolution of cinematic tropes in American films, by modelling complex network dynamics of said tropes. In Summer 2020, I worked with [Dr. Joyojeet Pal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/jopal/) and team, in the [Technology for Emerging Markets](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/theme/technology-for-emerging-markets/) group at Microsoft Research, India.  -->

In my free time, I love to read anything and everything I can get my hands on, and sometimes, I even write. I'm also a photography enthusiast, although I don't think I'm very good at it.

I am also a part of the founding and editorial team of the [BITS R&D blog](https://bitsrnd.wordpress.com), which documents the research endeavours of BITS students and alumni for public benefit. I love helping my juniors figure how to get into research as an undergrad, because I really benefited from my own seniors taking out the time to help me explore research, to see if it was the right career for me to pursue. So if you're reading this and need help, feel free to email me and I'd be happy to be a sounding board with whatever you'd like! -->

Beyond my research, I also enjoy [reading, playing board games, and amateur photography](../cool_stuff/2020-06-16-cool-stuff/)!
