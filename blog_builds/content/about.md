I'm Sachita, and I'm PhDing at Northwestern University in [Technology and Social Behaviour](https://tsb.northwestern.edu), a joint PhD program spanning Communication Studies üí¨ and Computer Science üñ•Ô∏è.

I work at the intersection of human-computer interaction and journalism, and design interactive AI-based systems that help science and tech journalists explore newsworthy scientific research, and offer supports for brainstorming and writing about it. 

Beyond my research, I also enjoy reading, watching films (and reviewing them on Letterboxd), amateur photography, and tennis! I help run the [HCI + Design book club](https://hci.northwestern.edu/news-events/phd-book-club.html) at Northwestern, and also log the books I read [on here](../books).

In 2020, I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering at [BITS Pilani's Goa Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/) in India, which is a beautiful place. It's really heaven on earth, if there is any. I feel incredibly lucky I got to experience this :) During my undergrad, I also conducted research at other pretty campuses, such as [Microsoft Research India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/) (virtually, boo!), [Northwestern University](https://amaral.northwestern.edu), [IISc Bangalore](http://dccc.iisc.ac.in), [IISER Pune](https://pbl.acads.iiserpune.ac.in/pbl-iiser-p), and [IIT Madras](https://home.iitm.ac.in/kraman/lab/).
