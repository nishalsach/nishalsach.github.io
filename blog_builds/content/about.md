I'm Sachita, and I am PhDing at Northwestern University in [Technology and Social Behaviour](https://tsb.northwestern.edu), a joint PhD program spanning Communication Studies üí¨ and Computer Science üñ•Ô∏è.

I work right at the intersection of human-computer interaction and journalism, and design interactive AI-based systems that help science and tech journalists explore newsworthy scientific research, and offer supports for brainstorming around it for their reporting. Doing this work at a communication school is super interesting: it means I am nudged to design and devise HCI/AI/NLP-based solutions based on problems people actually face, as well as loop back to study their impacts on these communities.

Beyond my research, I also enjoy reading, watching films (and reviewing them on Letterboxd), amateur photography, and tennis! I help run the [HCI + Design book club](https://hci.northwestern.edu/news-events/phd-book-club.html) at Northwestern, and also log the books I read [on here](../books).

In 2020, I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering at [BITS Pilani's Goa Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/) in India, which is a beautiful place. It's really heaven on earth, if there is any. I feel incredibly lucky I got to experience this :) I also conducted research at other pretty campuses, such as [Microsoft Research India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/) (virtually, boo!), [Northwestern University](https://amaral.northwestern.edu), [IISc Bangalore](http://dccc.iisc.ac.in), [IISER Pune](https://pbl.acads.iiserpune.ac.in/pbl-iiser-p), and [IIT Madras](https://home.iitm.ac.in/kraman/lab/).

<!-- - Over my research career thus far, I've worked with some wonderful people on some fascinating ideas such as:
    - running computer simulations to model evolutionary theories, 
    - designing visualizations to communicate the impact of climate change, 
    - studying the novelty of tropes in films, 
    - working with journalists to design recommender systems for newsrooms   -->


<!-- I completed my undergraduate thesis in 2019 under [Dr. Luis Amaral](https://amaral.northwestern.edu/people/amaral/) at Northwestern Univeristy, where I studied the interplay and evolution of cinematic tropes in American films, by modelling complex network dynamics of said tropes. In Summer 2020, I worked with [Dr. Joyojeet Pal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/jopal/) and team, in the [Technology for Emerging Markets](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/theme/technology-for-emerging-markets/) group at Microsoft Research, India.  -->

In my free time, I love to read anything and everything I can get my hands on, and sometimes, I even write. I'm also a photography enthusiast, although I don't think I'm very good at it.

I am also a part of the founding and editorial team of the [BITS R&D blog](https://bitsrnd.wordpress.com), which documents the research endeavours of BITS students and alumni for public benefit. I love helping my juniors figure how to get into research as an undergrad, because I really benefited from my own seniors taking out the time to help me explore research, to see if it was the right career for me to pursue. So if you're reading this and need help, feel free to email me and I'd be happy to be a sounding board with whatever you'd like! -->
