### Books and Stuff

My Reading List has, on average, 47 books on it at any given point of time. I am currently working my way through the works of Ann Patchett, and at the time of writing this, I am extremely taken with  [*The Dutch House*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dutch_House_(novel)). Another really cool book I read recently was Carl Bergstrom and Jevin West's [*Calling Bullshit*](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/563882/calling-bullshit-by-carl-t-bergstrom-and-jevin-d-west/). It is a tremendously engaging book about wading through the sheer amount of misinformation we find ourselves besieged by on the internet today, and I highly recommend it if this is an area of thought that you are interested in!


### Theatre

During my undergrad years, I spent a lot of time doing theatre with my uni's Drama Club. Some of my favourite playwrights are Edward Albee, Annie Baker and Will Eno.

I directed three full-length stage plays, assisted on two others, and competed at national-level collegiate theatre competitions thrice. Here's a poster for the last play I ever directed - Duncan Macmillan's Every Brilliant Thing, which we also adapted for a more Indian context. 

You can find some cool posters we made for my other plays on [this](../play_posters) page.

### Other Stuff I Do

- Play tabletop games with my friends - I am particularly a fan of Catan, Codenames and Love Letter.
- Play 90s-style point-and-click adventure games. The mania began with Monkey Island, continued with the Discworld games, and I have recently been daydreaming about making my own games with Twine or something similar.
- Pretend to learn the ukulele. 
- Take photos of stuff, I really really really enjoy (amateur) photography.
