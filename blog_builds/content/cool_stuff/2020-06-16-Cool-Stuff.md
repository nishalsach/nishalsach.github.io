### Books and Stuff

**Sep 2022**: I'm currently reading James Gleick's book, [The Information](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/60765/the-information-by-james-gleick/), which provides a richly detailed history of humanity's relationship with _information_ of all kinds - oral, written, digital! I'm really enjoying it because it weaves a very diverse set of ideas, people, and locations together to tell the story of how we've understood, catalogued, and communicated our ideas over the ages, and how the media that we use for these purposes has changed how we think.

### Theatre

During my undergrad years, I spent a lot of time doing theatre with my uni's Drama Club. Some of my favourite playwrights are Edward Albee, Annie Baker and Will Eno. 

I directed three full-length stage plays, assisted on two others, and competed at national-level collegiate theatre competitions thrice. Here's a poster for the last play I ever directed, [Duncan Macmillan's Every Brilliant Thing](https://www.dramatists.com/cgi-bin/db/single.asp?key=5451), which we also adapted for a more Indian context. 

<!-- You can find some cool posters we made for my other plays on [this](../play_posters) page.  -->

### Other Stuff I Do

- Play tabletop games with my friends - I am particularly a fan of Catan, Codenames and Love Letter.
- Play 90s-style point-and-click adventure games. The mania began with Monkey Island, continued with the Discworld games, and I have recently been daydreaming about making my own games with Twine or something similar.
- Take photos of stuff, I really really really enjoy (amateur) photography.
