## Books and Stuff

**Oct 2022**: I'm currently reading James Gleick's book, [_The Information_](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/60765/the-information-by-james-gleick/), which provides a very detailed history of humanity's relationship with _information_ - oral, written, digital, all kinds! I'm really enjoying it because it weaves a wide-ranging set of ideas, people, and locations together to tell the story of how we've understood, catalogued, and communicated our ideas over the ages, and how the media that we use for these purposes has changed how we think.

**Aug 2022**: I am chipping away at Jane Jacobs' excellent book on how we can build better, safer, more vibrant cities: [_The Death and Life of Great American Cities_](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_and_Life_of_Great_American_Cities). It's very life-changing in the way that it's really making me notice small nuances of the cities I've visited and lived in that made them the way they were! I hope to write a little essy about it after I'm done!

## Theatre

During my undergrad years, I spent a lot of time doing theatre with my uni's Drama Club. Some of my favourite playwrights are Edward Albee, Annie Baker and Will Eno. 

I directed three full-length stage plays, assisted on two others, and competed at national-level collegiate theatre competitions thrice. Here's a poster for the last play I ever directed, [Duncan Macmillan's _Every Brilliant Thing_](https://www.dramatists.com/cgi-bin/db/single.asp?key=5451), which we also adapted for a more Indian context. 

### Film

I love watching movies and thinking about why I (and everyone else) loves watching movies! Naturally, this has [bled into my work](/pdfs/2022-tropes-poster.pdf) but more than that, I love writing essays about [the films I've loved and adored](https://letterboxd.com/sachnish/likes/films/). One day, I hope to have an essay published by my favourite film publication, [_Bright Wall Dark Room_](https://www.brightwalldarkroom.com).

<!-- You can find some cool posters we made for my other plays on [this](../play_posters) page.  -->

## Other Stuff I Do

- Play tabletop games with my friends - I am particularly a fan of _Betrayal at House on the Hill_, _Codenames_, and _Love Letter_.
- Play 90s-style point-and-click adventure games. The mania began with Monkey Island, continued with the Discworld games, and I have recently been daydreaming about making my own games with Twine or something similar.
- Take photos of stuff, I really really really enjoy (amateur) photography.
