      <description>One thing I did not (really, truly, practically) take into consideration when I started doing the PhD was how difficult it would be. I learnt soon enough, of course. But you know that joke &amp;ndash; that the best time to be in a PhD program is the summer before it begins, when you impress everyone by telling them you&amp;rsquo;re going to get a PhD without having to actually do anything for it?</description>
