      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I wrote these posts, and I think it&amp;rsquo;s not for lack of reading, but for lack of engaging with newer papers. I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a lot more reading and writing for my prospectus, which majorly involves re-treading my own work as well as stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve already read and cited.
That being said, I&amp;rsquo;ve read a few books this year! Focusing on books has been an interesting change of pace than reading tons of one-off essays or papers.</description>
