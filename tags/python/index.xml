      <title>Reading and Writing Files in Python: Modifiers</title>

      <description>Different modes of reading and writing to files, and what they do:
r: Only read. This is the default if no mode argument is given. w: Only write. An existing file with the same name will be over-written. a: Append data to the end of the file. Still writing. r+: Both reading and writing and can be done. I never use this.
From the Python Docs:
Normally, files are opened in text mode, that means, you read and write strings from and to the file, which are encoded in a specific encoding.</description>

      <description>Click the given link to skip to the code and spare yourself my tortuous introduction: code for sklearn Pipeline debugging Transformer. Don&amp;rsquo;t click the link if you&amp;rsquo;re debugging at 2pm on a slow Thursday and want something, anything, to distract you from staring at VSCode and its quickly blurring lines of code. I can help you pretend you&amp;rsquo;re working as you scan the next few paragraphs of my inner monologue.</description>

      <description>Hello!
I&amp;rsquo;m honestly quite unsure of what SEO miracle led you here, given the enthusiastically descriptive, but less than optimal title for this post. I&amp;rsquo;m further unsure of why you actually clicked this link when it showed up. But does that make me any less grateful that you&amp;rsquo;re here? Certainly not!
I wrote this post to document my experiences while scraping a massive crowdsourced website called TVTropes. During this venture, I spent many an afternoon quite desperately Googling &amp;ldquo;ugh web-scraping is so annoying save me python&amp;rdquo;.</description>
