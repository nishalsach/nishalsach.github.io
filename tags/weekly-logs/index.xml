      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I wrote these posts, and I think it&amp;rsquo;s not for lack of reading, but for lack of engaging with newer papers. I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a lot more reading and writing for my prospectus, which majorly involves re-treading my own work as well as stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve already read and cited.
That being said, I&amp;rsquo;ve read a few books this year! Focusing on books has been an interesting change of pace than reading tons of one-off essays or papers.</description>

      <description>Cool readings and excerpts from this week:
The Business of the News Lots of news in January about media downsizing and layoffs. The news industry in the U.S. looks like it is in a precarious position, but I feel like it&amp;rsquo;s also been this way for a while now. In the meanwhile, Joshua Benton of Nieman Lab reminds us that while it can feel like the industry is in freefall, sometimes outlets can simply collapse because they were ill-conceived, ego-driven projects that were terribly run.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m trying out something new this year, where I maintain a log of cool things I read (or watch, or listen to) around my work or academic interests. I think logging and describing these things can be good for my sense-making process in the long term, or generally help me feel sane when I look at the calendar on a Friday and exclaim &amp;ldquo;Where did the week go? 🫠&amp;rdquo;. Now, I will know, where the week went.</description>
