      <description>Click the given link to skip to the code and spare yourself my tortuous introduction: code for sklearn Pipeline debugging Transformer. Don&amp;rsquo;t click the link if you&amp;rsquo;re debugging at 2pm on a slow Thursday and want something, anything, to distract you from staring at VSCode and its quickly blurring lines of code. I can help you pretend you&amp;rsquo;re working as you scan the next few paragraphs of my inner monologue.</description>

      <description>In 2019, I completed my undergrad thesis at Northwestern University, where I worked in Dr. Luis Amaral&amp;rsquo;s lab to model complex networks of tropes in American films starting from the 1890s.
I wrote a brief account of how I applied for my thesis, as well as my takeaways from this momentous experience, and it was published on BITS Goa&amp;rsquo;s blog for undergrad research experiences. Here&amp;rsquo;s a link to the post: Sachita Nishalâ€™s Thesis at Northwestern University!</description>

      <description>Hello!
I&amp;rsquo;m honestly quite unsure of what SEO miracle led you here, given the enthusiastically descriptive, but less than optimal title for this post. I&amp;rsquo;m further unsure of why you actually clicked this link when it showed up. But does that make me any less grateful that you&amp;rsquo;re here? Certainly not!
I wrote this post to document my experiences while scraping a massive crowdsourced website called TVTropes. During this venture, I spent many an afternoon quite desperately Googling &amp;ldquo;ugh web-scraping is so annoying save me python&amp;rdquo;.</description>
