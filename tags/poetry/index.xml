      <description>there’s always certain staples in my mind,
not quite glued in,
but sort of tackily clipped on somewhere in the gaps.
they come in flashes and in those mini chunks of moments -
on the bus, walking through a doorway,
squeezing soap out on my palms,
or while zipping up a really full suitcase.
like that really colourful human evolution network diagram thingy
i saw in a science museum once.</description>

      <description>hush, quiet now,
the dawn isn’t here yet.
it won’t be here for another hour or two.
or maybe you will snap your fingers (softly, surely!),
and it will unveil itself,
chirp by chirp,
until the sky’s blue sneaks in,
from between the crevices of your curtains.
you will have spent the night,
rubbing the soles of your feet underneath the table,
wishing they were gentler.

However, my most ambitious project by far has been to finally complete the Discworld books! Ever since I read Guards! Guards! earlier this year, I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to get my hands on the entire series. So here I am, stuck at home in the Age of COVID, currently reading: Sourcery (7/41)</description>
