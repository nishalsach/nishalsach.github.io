      <title>Reading and Writing Files in Python: Modifiers</title>

      <description>Different modes of reading and writing to files, and what they do:
r: Only read. This is the default if no mode argument is given. w: Only write. An existing file with the same name will be over-written. a: Append data to the end of the file. Still writing. r+: Both reading and writing and can be done. I never use this.
From the Python Docs:
Normally, files are opened in text mode, that means, you read and write strings from and to the file, which are encoded in a specific encoding.</description>

      <description>Note: All links are from BS v4.12.0 documentation and reference, but the gist should probably hold for a while.
BeautifulSoup4 + Python is a formidable combo for web-scraping when the territory I&amp;rsquo;m scraping in is uncertain, webpages are static, and I need to spin up something quick and dirty so I can hunt around through the HTML to specifically extract what I need.
Another thing is: when pulling web data with BS4, sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s really handy to keep separate files of the subset/tags/text in a page that are of interest, but then also save original HTML files just to have them on hand in case extraction does not go according to plan.</description>
