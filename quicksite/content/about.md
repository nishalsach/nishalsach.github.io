Hi, I'm Sachita Nishal, and I study Computer Science at BITS Pilani in Goa. Welcome to my homepage! In Fall 2020, I will be joining Northwestern University as a PhD student in [Technology and Social Behaviour](https://tsb.northwestern.edu), an interdisciplinary program spanning Communication Studies and Computer Science. Currently, I'm interning with [Dr. Joyojeet Pal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/jopal/) in the [Technology for Emerging Markets](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/theme/technology-for-emerging-markets/) group at Microsoft Research, India. 

I completed my undergraduate thesis under [Dr. Luis Amaral](https://amaral.northwestern.edu/people/amaral/) at Northwestern Univeristy, where I studied the interplay and evolution of cinematic tropes in American films, by modelling complex network dynamics of said tropes. In Summer 2018, I worked under [Dr. Karthik Raman](https://home.iitm.ac.in/kraman/lab/karthik/) at IIT Madras, on studying protein-ligand interactions for medical drug design, using convolutional neural networks to predict these linkage strengths.

In my free time, I love to read anything and everything I can get my hands on. Most recently, I have procrastinated upon many a project while immersed in Ken Liu's brand of speculative science-fiction, and James Gleick's exciting narrative nonfiction! I'm also a photography enthusiast, although I don't think I'm very good at it.

I am also a part of the founding and editorial team of the [BITS R&D blog](https://bitsrnd.wordpress.com), which documents the research endeavours of BITS students and alumni for public benefit.

You can find out about some other interesting, non-researchy stuff I do in my life [here](../cool_stuff/2020-06-16-cool-stuff/)!
