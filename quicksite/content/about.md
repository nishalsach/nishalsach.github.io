Hi, I'm Sachita Nishal, and I am a 2nd-year PhD student at Northwestern University in [Technology and Social Behaviour](https://tsb.northwestern.edu), a joint PhD program spanning Communication Studies and Computer Science.

In 2020, I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering at [BITS Pilani's Goa Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/) in India, and I don't think I will ever get over how devastatingly beautiful and other-worldly Goa is. Goan summer sunsets and monsoon petrichors still evoke some extremely fond memories :)

My recent projects lie in the domain of Computational Social Science, and I am currently working on a) building tools to enable science journalists to discover newsworthy research, and b) studying novelty in the music industry using quantitative MIR features. 

I completed my undergraduate thesis in 2019 under [Dr. Luis Amaral](https://amaral.northwestern.edu/people/amaral/) at Northwestern Univeristy, where I studied the interplay and evolution of cinematic tropes in American films, by modelling complex network dynamics of said tropes. In Summer 2020, I worked with [Dr. Joyojeet Pal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/jopal/) and team, in the [Technology for Emerging Markets](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/theme/technology-for-emerging-markets/) group at Microsoft Research, India.

In my free time, I love to read anything and everything I can get my hands on, and sometimes, I even write. I'm also a photography enthusiast, although I don't think I'm very good at it.

I am also a part of the founding and editorial team of the [BITS R&D blog](https://bitsrnd.wordpress.com), which documents the research endeavours of BITS students and alumni for public benefit. I love helping my juniors with figure how to get into research as an undergrad, because I really benefited from my own seniors taking out the time to help me explore research and understand if it was the right career for me to pursue. So if you're reading this and need help, feel free to email me and I'd be happy to be a sounding board with whatever you'd like!
