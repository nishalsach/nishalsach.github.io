Hi, I am Sachita Nishal, and I study Computer Science at BITS Pilani in Goa. Welcome to my homepage!

<!-- {{< figure class="floatright" src="img/broadway.png" width="380" title="waddup Chicago">}}
 -->
I'm extremely fascinated by how complex networks of people, ideas and machines interact, and how these interactions change the fabric of our society. With this broader research interest in mind, I am joining Northwestern University's PhD program in Technology and Social Behaviour in Fall 2020. 

I am also a part of the founding and editorial team of the BITS R&D blog, which documents the research endeavours of BITS students and alumni for public benefit.

You can find out about some other stuff I do in my life [here](https://nishalsach.github.io/posts/2020-06-16-cool-stuff/)!
