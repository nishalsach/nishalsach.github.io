In 2019, I completed my undergrad thesis at Northwestern University, where I worked in [Dr. Luis Amaral's lab](https://amaral.northwestern.edu/people/amaral/) to model complex networks of tropes in American films starting from the 1890s. 

I wrote a brief account of how I applied for my thesis, as well as my takeaways from this momentous experience, and it was published on BITS Goa's blog for undergrad research experiences. Here's a link to the post: [Sachita Nishalâ€™s Thesis at Northwestern University!](https://bitsrnd.wordpress.com/2020/06/26/sachitas-thesis-in-the-windy-city/0)

I hope it can be useful to other undergrad researchers applying for research internships to academic labs, especially for international students!
