I am extremely passionate about literature, cinema and theatre, and I have directed several plays as part of BITS  Goa's theatre society. Some of my favourite playwrights are Edward Albee, Annie Baker and Will Eno. Most recently, I directed an adaptation of a wonderfully life-affirming play called ‘Every Brilliant Thing’ (originally written by Duncan Macmillan).
