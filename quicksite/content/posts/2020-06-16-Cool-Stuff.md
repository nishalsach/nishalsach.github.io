### Books and Stuff

My Reading List has, on average, 47 books on it at any given point of time. However, my most ambitious project by far has been to finally complete the Discworld books! Ever since I read [*Guards! Guards!*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guards!_Guards!) earlier this year, I've been meaning to get my hands on the entire series. So here I am, stuck at home in the Age of COVID, currently reading: [*Sourcery*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sourcery) (7/41)

### Theatre

During my undergrad years, I spent a lot of time doing theatre with my uni's Drama Club. Some of my favourite playwrights are Edward Albee, Annie Baker and Will Eno. I directed three full-length stage plays, assisted on two others, and competed at national-level collegiate theatre competitions thrice. Here are some  cool posters we made for these plays:

### Writing

I really like writing poems and essays (about films, books and me!), and I even send them out into the world on rare occasions. [Here's](../../poems_pages/gentle/) a poem I wrote that I really like, and here's [another](../../poems_pages/staples/). You can tell me what you think about them, or not, it's okay. 

### Other Stuff I Do

- Make Spotify playlists about extremely specific things I feel during car rides, in the midst of tortuous summers, and when it drizzles in Goa. Find them [here](https://open.spotify.com/user/parikalpanaa), apologies in advance.
- Play tabletop games with my friends - I am particularly a fan of Catan, Codenames and Love Letter.
- Make amateur animations with Blender, which is honestly a gift! (Blender, not my animations. Definitely not my animations.)
- Play 90s-style point-and-click adventure games. The mania began with Monkey Island, and I can't get enough of Thimbleweed Park right now!
