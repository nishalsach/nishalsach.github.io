hush, quiet now,  
the dawn isn’t here yet.  
it won’t be here for another hour or two.  

or maybe you will snap your fingers (softly, surely!),  
and it will unveil itself,   
chirp by chirp,  
until the sky’s blue sneaks in,  
from between the crevices of your curtains.  

you will have spent the night,  
rubbing the soles of your feet underneath the table,  
wishing they were gentler.  
pausing to press down on   
risky door handles,  
and padding into the kitchen,  
longing for the elusive satisfaction   
of a good snack.  

rummaging deliberately through a myriad   
of cabinets and drawers and boxes,  
and then returning to clack away  
at a partly defunct keyboard that gleams   
like the moonlight you can’t quite catch   
from behind   
the new ochre apartment complexes  
that lurk behind your window.  

the air conditioner hums almost noiselessly (almost),  
your feet slip and slide against each other,   
the keyboard marks the occasional burst of an idea  
with its resounding thwacks.  

all else is quiet.  
dawn will arrive soon,   
you’ll be awake to bear witness.
