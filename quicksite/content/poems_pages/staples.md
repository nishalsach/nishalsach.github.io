there’s always certain staples in my mind,  
not quite glued in,  
but sort of tackily clipped on somewhere in the gaps.  
they come in flashes and in those mini chunks of moments -  
on the bus, walking through a doorway,  
squeezing soap out on my palms,  
or while zipping up a really full suitcase.  

like that really colourful human evolution network diagram thingy  
i saw in a science museum once.  
and i remember clicking around on the screen  
while my sister just looked on  
both our eyes glazed over in wonder.  

and and like that really good cold coffee i had once  
up in the hills   
at some coffee plantation somewhere.  
i can still almost taste it for a millisecond sometimes  
but then it disseminates while halfway there.  

sometimes i think about how if water  
could be precisely spherical blue globs floating around,  
i could just pick my favourite out of mid-air,  
pop it in like good gum,  
feel it explode on my tongue.  

and if you’re reading or listening to this  
there’s no symbolism anywhere here  
i’m no real poet, just a talker really.  
talking intangible things, talking about  
just stuff floating around my head sometimes.  
just recurring smidgeons of thought -  
not quite entire memories  
not quite fulsome daydreams  
just staples really.
