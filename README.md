# Sachita Nishal

Hi, this is the repo for my Hugo blog. 

Done:

- Figured out the filepaths in general
- Made footnotes work in head.html (means I have to do relative indexing)
- Got img tags working in config.toml
- Fixed the syntax highlighting for code in posts in config.toml
- Added my intro to my landing page (29 June 2020)
- Add captions to images (29 June 2020) - created a new custom class in main.css
