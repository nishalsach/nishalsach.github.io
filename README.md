Hi, this is the repo for my Hugo blog. 

Content:

- Edit About Me to add my education
- Accommodate my projects somewhere
- Update cool stuff

CSS:

- Add captions to images

Done:

- Figured out the filepaths in general
- Made footnotes work in head.html (means I have to do relative indexing)
- Got img tags working in config.toml
- Fixed the syntax highlighting for code in posts in config.toml
