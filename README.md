# To Do (updated June 18, 2022)

### Content

- Update CV and Resume. Link CV on homepage and Resume in the tab
- Host publication PDFs on my site and render them
- Make a dedicated page for publications that auto-updates from markdown files
- On Home page: add a news pane + selected publications
- Maybe bring back the extended about me with a greater focus on how I do my research?

### Design

- Fix the heading sizes of header and body
- Improve responsiveness of site by setting some sort of min-width on text
- Test shortcodes for buttons: done using [here](http://oostens.me/posts/hugo-button-shortcode/) and an scss2css converter
