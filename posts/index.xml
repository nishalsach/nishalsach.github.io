      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I wrote these posts, and I think it&amp;rsquo;s not for lack of reading, but for lack of engaging with newer papers. I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a lot more reading and writing for my prospectus, which majorly involves re-treading my own work as well as stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve already read and cited.
That being said, I&amp;rsquo;ve read a few books this year! Focusing on books has been an interesting change of pace than reading tons of one-off essays or papers.</description>

      <description>I read this over the Fall and Winter quarters with our HCI+Design Book Club at Northwestern. It&amp;rsquo;s a landmark work in HCI and had been on my bucket list for a long time, so I was glad to finally get to it, and wrest with some of its more complex and thought-provoking themes in our little reading group. We read a chapter a week and the result of this was that I genuinely really enjoyed reading it and digging into its meaty bits1!</description>

      <description>Cool readings and excerpts from this week:
The Business of the News Lots of news in January about media downsizing and layoffs. The news industry in the U.S. looks like it is in a precarious position, but I feel like it&amp;rsquo;s also been this way for a while now. In the meanwhile, Joshua Benton of Nieman Lab reminds us that while it can feel like the industry is in freefall, sometimes outlets can simply collapse because they were ill-conceived, ego-driven projects that were terribly run.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m trying out something new this year, where I maintain a log of cool things I read (or watch, or listen to) around my work or academic interests. I think logging and describing these things can be good for my sense-making process in the long term, or generally help me feel sane when I look at the calendar on a Friday and exclaim &amp;ldquo;Where did the week go? ðŸ« &amp;rdquo;. Now, I will know, where the week went.</description>

      <title>Reading and Writing Files in Python: Modifiers</title>
      <link>https://nishalsach.github.io/posts/2023-05-23-reading-writing-modifiers/</link>

      <description>Different modes of reading and writing to files, and what they do:
r: Only read. This is the default if no mode argument is given.
w: Only write. An existing file with the same name will be over-written.
a: Append data to the end of the file. Still writing.
r+: Both reading and writing and can be done. I never use this.
From the Python Docs:
Normally, files are opened in text mode, that means, you read and write strings from and to the file, which are encoded in a specific encoding.</description>

      <title>BeautifulSoup4Dummies</title>

      <description>Note: All links are from BS v4.12.0 documentation and reference, but the gist should probably hold for a while.
BeautifulSoup4 + Python is a formidable combo for web-scraping when the territory I&amp;rsquo;m scraping in is uncertain, webpages are static, and I need to spin up something quick and dirty so I can hunt around through the HTML to specifically extract what I need.
Another thing is: when pulling web data with BS4, sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s really handy to keep separate files of the subset/tags/text in a page that are of interest, but then also save original HTML files just to have them on hand in case extraction does not go according to plan.</description>

      <title>Two Years into the PhD: Thoughts and Half-thoughts</title>

      <description>One thing I did not (really, truly, practically) take into consideration when I started doing the PhD was how difficult it would be. I learnt soon enough, of course. But you know that joke &amp;ndash; that the best time to be in a PhD program is the summer before it begins, when you impress everyone by telling them you&amp;rsquo;re going to get a PhD without having to actually do anything for it?</description>

      <title>A Short Primer on Mutual Information</title>
      <link>https://nishalsach.github.io/posts/2022-04-25-short-primer_mi/</link>

      <description>Definitions Conceptual Definition: MI is the reduction in uncertainty when predicting one variable (&amp;ldquo;outcome&amp;rdquo;) in a system, if we know the value of another variable in the system. It will always be &amp;gt;=0, and higher values mean higher dependency between the two variables Formula (for discrete processes/variables X1 and X2): As must be apparent, for two independent variables, MI = 0. Eg. Two coins are tossed; the results of one coin do not help us measure the results of the other in any way Another way to look at this (and I still have some trouble wrapping my head around this) is that MI is the KL Divergence in going from the joint distribution P(X1, X2) to the product of the marginal distributions P(X1).</description>

      <description>Click the given link to skip to the code and spare yourself my tortuous introduction: code for sklearn Pipeline debugging Transformer. Don&amp;rsquo;t click the link if you&amp;rsquo;re debugging at 2pm on a slow Thursday and want something, anything, to distract you from staring at VSCode and its quickly blurring lines of code. I can help you pretend you&amp;rsquo;re working as you scan the next few paragraphs of my inner monologue.</description>

      <title>My Thesis Experience at Northwestern University</title>

      <description>In 2019, I completed my undergrad thesis at Northwestern University, where I worked in Dr. Luis Amaral&amp;rsquo;s lab to model complex networks of tropes in American films starting from the 1890s.
I wrote a brief account of how I applied for my thesis, as well as my takeaways from this momentous experience, and it was published on BITS Goa&amp;rsquo;s blog for undergrad research experiences. Here&amp;rsquo;s a link to the post: Sachita Nishalâ€™s Thesis at Northwestern University!</description>

      <description>Hi.
Welcome.
You can choose to skip right to the hacks with this handy index:
Filepaths in Hugo Footnotes in Markdown HTML Tags for Images in Markdown Syntax Highlighting for Code in Markdown Or, you can bear witness to an overly detailed and meandering tale about my journey navigating the horrific ills of modern technology, below.
So, I am proud to announce that as of today, June 12 2020, I have transitioned out of Jekyll, and am the owner of a shiny new blog built with Hugo.</description>

      <title>Lessons From a Massive(ly-Annoying) Scraping Project in Python</title>

      <description>Hello!
I&amp;rsquo;m honestly quite unsure of what SEO miracle led you here, given the enthusiastically descriptive, but less than optimal title for this post. I&amp;rsquo;m further unsure of why you actually clicked this link when it showed up. But does that make me any less grateful that you&amp;rsquo;re here? Certainly not!
I wrote this post to document my experiences while scraping a massive crowdsourced website called TVTropes. During this venture, I spent many an afternoon quite desperately Googling &amp;ldquo;ugh web-scraping is so annoying save me python&amp;rdquo;.</description>
