      <description>In 2019, I completed my undergrad thesis at Northwestern University, where I worked in Dr. Luis Amaral&amp;rsquo;s lab to model complex networks of tropes in American films starting from the 1890s.
I wrote a brief account of how I applied for my thesis, as well as my takeaways from this momentous experience, and it was published on BITS Goa&amp;rsquo;s blog for undergrad research experiences. Here&amp;rsquo;s a link to the post: Sachita Nishalâ€™s Thesis at Northwestern University!</description>

      <description>Hi.
Welcome.
You can choose to skip right to the hacks with this handy index:
 Filepaths in Hugo Footnotes in Markdown HTML Tags for Images in Markdown Syntax Highlighting for Code in Markdown  Or, you can bear witness to an overly detailed and meandering tale about my journey navigating the horrific ills of modern technology, below.
So, I am proud to announce that as of today, June 12 2020, I have transitioned out of Jekyll, and am the owner of a shiny new blog built with Hugo.</description>

      <description>.myDiv { /* border: 5px outset red;*/ height: 630px; text-align: center; margin:10; }  Books and Stuff My Reading List has, on average, 47 books on it at any given point of time. I am currently working my way through the works of Ann Patchett, and at the time of writing this, I am extremely taken with The Dutch House. Another really cool book I read recently was Carl Bergstrom and Jevin West&amp;rsquo;s Calling Bullshit.</description>

      <description>-- Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Sachita Nishal, and I am a 2nd-year PhD student at Northwestern University in Technology and Social Behaviour, a joint PhD program spanning Communication Studies and Computer Science.
 Goan summer sunsets can be spectacular!  In 2020, I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering at BITS Pilani&amp;rsquo;s Goa Campus in India, and I don&amp;rsquo;t think I will ever get over how devastatingly beautiful and other-worldly Goa is.</description>

      <description>Hello!
I&amp;rsquo;m honestly quite unsure of what SEO miracle led you here, given the enthusiastically descriptive, but less than optimal title for this post. I&amp;rsquo;m further unsure of why you actually clicked this link when it showed up. But does that make me any less grateful that you&amp;rsquo;re here? Certainly not!
I wrote this post to document my experiences while scraping a massive crowdsourced website called TVTropes. During this venture, I spent many an afternoon quite desperately Googling &amp;ldquo;ugh web-scraping is so annoying save me python&amp;rdquo;.</description>
