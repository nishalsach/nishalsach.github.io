      <description>Hi.
Welcome.
You can choose to skip right to the hacks with this handy index:
 Filepaths in Hugo Footnotes in Markdown HTML Tags for Images in Markdown Syntax Highlighting for Code in Markdown  Or, you can bear witness to an overly detailed and meandering tale about my journey navigating the horrific ills of modern technology, below.
So, I am proud to announce that as of today, June 12 2020, I have transitioned out of Jekyll, and am the owner of a shiny new blog built with Hugo.</description>

      <description>I am extremely passionate about literature, cinema and theatre, and I have directed several plays as part of BITS Goa&amp;rsquo;s theatre society. Some of my favourite playwrights are Edward Albee, Annie Baker and Will Eno. Most recently, I directed an adaptation of a wonderfully life-affirming play called ‘Every Brilliant Thing’ (originally written by Duncan Macmillan).</description>

      <description>Hello!
I&amp;rsquo;m honestly quite unsure of what SEO miracle led you here, given the enthusiastically descriptive, but less than optimal title for this post. I&amp;rsquo;m further unsure of why you actually clicked this link when it showed up. But does that make me any less grateful that you&amp;rsquo;re here? Certainly not!
I wrote this post to document my experiences while scraping a massive crowdsourced website called TVTropes. During this venture, I spent many an afternoon quite desperately Googling &amp;ldquo;ugh web-scraping is so annoying save me python&amp;rdquo;.</description>
