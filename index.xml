      <description>there’s always certain staples in my mind,
not quite glued in,
but sort of tackily clipped on somewhere in the gaps.
they come in flashes and in those mini chunks of moments -
on the bus, walking through a doorway,
squeezing soap out on my palms,
or while zipping up a really full suitcase.
like that really colourful human evolution network diagram thingy
i saw in a science museum once.</description>

      <description>hush, quiet now,
the dawn isn’t here yet.
it won’t be here for another hour or two.
or maybe you will snap your fingers (softly, surely!),
and it will unveil itself,
chirp by chirp,
until the sky’s blue sneaks in,
from between the crevices of your curtains.
you will have spent the night,
rubbing the soles of your feet underneath the table,
wishing they were gentler.

      <description>Hi.
Welcome.
You can choose to skip right to the hacks with this handy index:
 Filepaths in Hugo Footnotes in Markdown HTML Tags for Images in Markdown Syntax Highlighting for Code in Markdown  Or, you can bear witness to an overly detailed and meandering tale about my journey navigating the horrific ills of modern technology, below.
So, I am proud to announce that as of today, June 12 2020, I have transitioned out of Jekyll, and am the owner of a shiny new blog built with Hugo.</description>

      <description>.myDiv { /* border: 5px outset red;*/ height: 630px; text-align: center; margin:10; }  Books and Stuff My Reading List has, on average, 47 books on it at any given point of time. However, my most ambitious project by far has been to finally complete the Discworld books! Ever since I read Guards! Guards! earlier this year, I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to get my hands on the entire series. So here I am, stuck at home in the Age of COVID, currently reading: Sourcery (7/41)</description>

      <description>Hello!
I&amp;rsquo;m honestly quite unsure of what SEO miracle led you here, given the enthusiastically descriptive, but less than optimal title for this post. I&amp;rsquo;m further unsure of why you actually clicked this link when it showed up. But does that make me any less grateful that you&amp;rsquo;re here? Certainly not!
I wrote this post to document my experiences while scraping a massive crowdsourced website called TVTropes. During this venture, I spent many an afternoon quite desperately Googling &amp;ldquo;ugh web-scraping is so annoying save me python&amp;rdquo;.</description>
